Flight delay data and predictions for 2018

Flight delays are a major problem for the current aviation industry.  Data science is needed to show the statistics surrounding flight delays and if possible, predictions.  

The purpose of this project is to display flight delay data in Plotly and Tableau and use machine learning to make predictions regarding future delays by airport, airline, and country/state.

Hypothesis: Flight delays are less prevalent with larger and more profitable airlines.

Our goal is to clearly demonstrate the value of machine learning for analyizing and predicting air traffic delay in daily operation.
